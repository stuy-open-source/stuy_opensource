## Game Summary/Objective (Taken from the World of Goo Wikipedia Page!)
  The game is built around the idea of creating large structures using balls of goo. The main objective of the game is to get a requisite number of goo balls to a pipe designed to represent the exit. In order to do so, the player must use the goo balls to construct bridges, towers, and other structures to overcome gravity and various terrain difficulties such as chasms, hills, spikes, windmills, or cliffs. There are several types of goo balls in the game, each of which has unique properties. The player must exploit combinations of these goo balls in order to complete each level. 


## Instructions
* Import Fisica library into Processing <http://www.ricardmarxer.com/fisica/>
* Run WorldOfGUI/WorldOfGUI.pde in the Processing IDE
* Hover mouse over 2 goos that you want to connect
* Press 'G' key to add goo to your structure (you may need to click on the processing window when putting down your first goo)
* If you hovered over a goo but no longer want to to connect it, move your mouse away from it

## Features
* Ability to build structures from goo
* Some levels include obstacles
* 3 levels
* Score counter (each goo leftover gives you 10 points)

## Bugs
* Physics is not always perfect
