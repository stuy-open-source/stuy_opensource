bugs: all commented out or the bugged features are not being used

updates: 

Controls: 
z- shoot
ctrl- toogle direction lock
c- hold to change direction lock
shift- focus
wasd- move second screen in test game
arrow keys- move
v b - turns worm left or right
l k - strinks and enlarges gap between segments and nodes in worm (forgot which is which)
n- accelerates worm
m- decelerates worm
worm movements are meant to be controled by the computer in the future,
as planned attack patterns require control over other segments besides the head.
Control varies on friction values which is currently not adjustable yet.


see if you can move the worm to the center of the screen(get rid of the other window
by moving worm out of bounds then back in again)
press J for attack pattern 1
press h after j for attack pattern 2
worm A.I. will be worked on after enough attack patterns have been made
Note: the worm's friction depends on its attack pattern, so pressing J will also change
the worm's movement.
